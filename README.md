# SysMLinJavaLibrary
The SysMLinJavaLibrary repository contains a library of reusable model elements in SysMLinJava.  The library is in its initial stages (not a lot of elements) but will grow over time.  As a github repository, the library will be eventually open to SysMLinJava modelers to contribute their open-source modeling works to the SysMLinJava community via the library.

## Reusable Model Elements Include ...
Currently, the library includes the following:

### Value Types
While the SysMLinJava API/MDF already contains numerous value types, the library includes a few additional.  This part of the library is expected to grow with many more value types.

### Comments
Many SysMLinJava models tend to use comments similar, if not identical to, those comments included in the library.  The part of the library contains comments regarding commonly used hyperlinks, rationales, and element groups.

### Requirements
SysML requirements are frequently used in SysMLinJava models and this section of the library contains/will contain some commonly used types of requirements.  It is anticipated that these requirements will serve more as templates for customized requirements rather than actual unchanged requirements.

### Components
Frequently used as "parts" of block elements, the library components can be reused as is or as modifiable elements in the SysMLinJava model.  Currently, the library contains a few block elements for communications, services, and messaging parts, but is anticipated to grow with various other types.

### Common Elements
Finally, the library contains some "common" elements.  These common elements include such items as common ports, signals, messages, events, etc. that are used by other library elements and/or can be used by custom model elements as needed.
